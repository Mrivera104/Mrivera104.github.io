More broadly, I am passionate about population genomics and its applications for the conservation and management of long-lived mammals.\nI love diving into genomic mysteries, working on data visualization, and finding new ways to use bioinformatics for conservation. When I’m not at my computer, you can find me exploring tide pools, making art, or enjoying a good cup of coffee ☕🌿"
