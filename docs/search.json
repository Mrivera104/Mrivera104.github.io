More broadly, I am passionate about population genetics and its applications for the conservation and management of long-lived mammals.\nI love diving into genomic mysteries, working on data visualization, and finding new ways to use bioinformatics for conservation. When Iâ€™m not at my computer, you can find me exploring tide pools, hiking coastal trails, or enjoying a good cup of coffee! â˜•ðŸŒ¿"
