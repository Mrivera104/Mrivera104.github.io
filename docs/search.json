    "text": "Hello there! My name is Milagros Guadalupe Rivera and I am a PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I am currently studying the genetics of northern elephant seals with a specific interest in demographic recovery of the species after a recent population bottleneck. What does that mean for their genetics and overall fitness? Letâ€™s find out together! More broadly, I enjoy population genetics and its application towards the conservation and management of long-lived mammals."
